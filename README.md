# Bennett
+ presto pipeline
+ manual preprocessing of sequencing from sequencing core
+ automate up to IMGT upload; outputing into dirs that make sense


#Duval
+ transfer new data
+ genes with most mutations across samples
+ non-normal, non-synonymous mutation frequency
+ something like:
    s1  s2  s3  total
g1  1   1   0   2
g2  0   0   1   1
g3  1   1   1   3


#HITS-CLIP
+ mirna abundances on new processing style
+ new samples through pipeline
+ ucsc hub
+ 1-58
+ 1-50 + 1, 51, 52-57 +1, 58

# Poly(A)
# Ribosome stuffs
+ analyzing what is different between time points
+ determine what is transcribed vs what is regulated prior to reaching the ribosome
+ set of genes that are changing
+ validate at protein level

#Nicoli
+ annotations for genes sent in email
+ cytoscape networks

#Tesla
+ set up experiment to test execution time to cpus used
+ test common aligners gsnap, novoalign, etc using 1,2,4,6,8,12 cpus
+ plot results
+ gsnap also has -B and could test 0,1,2,3,4,5
