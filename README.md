Next generation sequencing was conducted on triplicate RNA samples of 
nonmetastatic Dunn and the Fidler selected metastatic DLM8 subline. These 
samples were extracted from both cells grown in culture and tumors grown in 
mice. The samples were purified using dual rounds of OligodT column 
purification. In addition, DLM8 cells were treated in culture with 
2-deoxyglucose to determine the effect of this agent on cellular function.
